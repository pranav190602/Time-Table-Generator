## Introduction
The timetabling problems are essentially the problems that deal with effective distribution of resources. 

During the timetabling process many constraints have to be considered. Resources are usually limited and no two tasks should occupy one particular resource at the same time. For most of the timetabling problems it has been shown that they are NP-hard, and that they can not be solved in polynomial time using a deterministic algorithm. Hence, genetic algorithms could provide us with a feasible solution in a reasonable time.

Our project is titled “TIME TABLE GENERATOR FOR COLLEGE”. The "Timetable Generator" simplifies scheduling with these key features:

Automated Timetable Generation: It automates timetable creation based on teacher availability, classroom capacity, and course requirements.

Customizable Templates: Administrators can create templates for various schedules, making it adaptable to different academic or organizational structures.

Conflict Resolution: The system identifies and resolves scheduling conflicts, ensuring optimal resource allocation.

Integration: Seamless integration with existing systems ensures smooth data exchange.

Methods Used: It leverages MVC Architecture, and robust database management,Genetic Algorithm.

Conclusion: The "Timetable Generator" enhances efficiency and productivity by streamlining scheduling processes for educational institutions and organizations.
